# MedicationExpirationTracker-Data-Kinght-AIT
This project helps users track medication expiry dates by scanning labels with a camera. Using Optical Character Recognition (OCR), it extracts key details like the medication name, expiry date, and dosage from the image. The extracted data is then stored in a database for easy access, ensuring medications are used before they expire.
